	The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) has the highest impact factor of all general medical journals (53.48 based on 2010 metrics) and a print circulation of almost 150000.  In addition, the NEJM  provides free online access to its archived research articles from 6 months after publication. Consequently, because of its ‘impact’ and ‘reach’, the NEJM is an attractive target for article publication. 
<br> <br> 
Wager et al (PLoS ONE 2010; 5[10]: e13591) showed that the NEJM published more randomized controlled trials (RCTs) solely funded by industry than other ‘top-tier’general medical journals, such as the Journal of the American Medical Association (~30 vs 15 manuscripts/year [2002–2008], respectively). 
<br> <br> 
Because of its characteristics, industry sponsors are often keen to submit manuscripts reporting the results of their clinical research to the NEJM.  However, the journal does have a very high rejection rate (~95% according to Journal Selector).  In order to provide industry sponsors with better evidence regarding the likelihood of acceptance in the NEJM, we profiled industry-funded RCTs published in the journal to evaluate any factors that may provide insights on successful manuscript submission.<br> <br>
